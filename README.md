# ChaoticFractals
Java Code for chaotic fractals from the Numberphile video titled "Chaos Game"

the App creates regular polygon of given sides and iterates for given number of points,
each time getting randomly picking a point from the verticies of the regular polygon and
going some fraction of the way there. the point is plotted and cycle continues.
The fraction of the way there is decided by the number of sides(see Panel.java line 33, 34)
